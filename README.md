# Cafe-Sales-Analysis
A group of coffee loving University of Sydney alumni had the business idea of setting up a cafe on University of Sydney campus that only opens at night,To test their business plan and attract potential investors, they opened a pop up store next to the Fisher Library during the second semester of 2019. The trading hours of the pop up store is between 7pm and 1am for 7 days a week. They named the shop Cafe Insomnia. Individual transaction records of the pop up store are collected from 2019 July 22 to 2019 December 22. In addition to collecting purchase related information, each customer was asked to select where on campus she or he was studying and whether it is raining . The founders of Cafe Insomnia are interested in knowing what affects their coffee sales on an hourly basis.
